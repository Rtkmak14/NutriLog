    * This project benefited from Microsoft Copilot’s support in pseudocode generation, architectural planning, syntax debugging, and initial README composition.

# Technologies Used
* JavaScript (ES6+) – Core language for backend and frontend logic
* Node.js + Express – Server-side framework for routing and middleware
* MongoDB + Mongoose – NoSQL database and schema modeling
* EJS – Templating engine for dynamic HTML rendering
* CSS3 – Custom styling with Google Fonts and responsive layout

# Future Enhancements
* Introduce a calendar-based view where users can log foods by day, visualize nutrient intake, and reflect on their eating habits over time. This feature will support journaling, streak tracking, and personalized feedback.
* Aggregate user data to surface meaningful insights—such as average daily protein intake, most frequently logged food types, or nutrient gaps. Visual charts and summaries will help users spot patterns and make informed decisions.
* Add icons, hover states, and expandable details to each food tile for richer interaction and accessibility.
